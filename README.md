# EvaCity

EvaCity is a project created as a final project of the Computer Science degree by University of Granada for Smart Cities and developed in C# ASP.NET MVC.

This web application offers citizens a channel to communicate with the local government and allows them to propose new projects related to sustainable energies, sustainable mobility, pollution, recycling and sustainable business to make a better city.

Moreover, the local government can inform the citizens about the projects that they are going to implement in the city.
